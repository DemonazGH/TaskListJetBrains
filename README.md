# TaskListJetBrains
<br>STAGE 1<br>
<br>Read a list with tasks from standard input and print it.<br>
<br>STAGE 2<br>
<br>Add a new menu to add new tasks to the list.<br>
<br>STAGE 3<br>
<br>Add deadlines and priorities to tasks. They will help you organize your tasks more efficiently.<br>
<br>STAGE 4<br>
<br>Add more options to the program menu. From now on, we will be able to edit and delete tasks.<br>
<br>STAGE 5<br>
<br>Add colors and frames to get more style with the tasks printout. The program will also check the deadlines of the tasks and mark it with the status color.<br>
<br>STAGE 6<br>
<br>In this stage, we'll make the program save the list into a text file in JSON format. Each time it starts, it should check for the file and process it.<br>
